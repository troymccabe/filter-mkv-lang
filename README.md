# filter-mkv-lang
Use MKVMerge to strip all but a specified language from your .mkvs. [USE AT YOUR OWN RISK]

## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This worked for my files, but I obviously couldn't test this on yours. Using this script is at your own risk, and I assume no responsibility for lost/damaged files

## Usage
1. Download the repo (or just grab `filter_mkv_lang.py`)
2. From command line: `py filter_mkv_lang.py -d /path/to/mkvs -l 3-char_lang_code -m /path/to/mkvmerge`
